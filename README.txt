Hello there fellow reader, 

My name is Eileen, and I'd like to start this by talking about why I'm making this page. This website will solely be used to store my project; in summary, this will be used as a kind of portfolio in case I need one later on. I will add more content to the website as I learn more about computer science and make more projects. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a nice day!

Goodbye, 
Eileen
